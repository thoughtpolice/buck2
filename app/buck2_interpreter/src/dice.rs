//! The dice module contains the interpreter's integration with dice. This
//! module contains the extension traits that we implement for `Arc<DiceCtx>`
//! (the implementations of the traits are in the submodules).
//!
//! Several of these extension traits provide implementations of our delegate/DI
//! traits that are themselves build on dice (ex DiceInterpreterFileOps
//! implements InterpreterFileOps by basically putting DefaultInterpreterFileOps
//! onto the dice graph).
