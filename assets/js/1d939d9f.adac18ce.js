It's possible that the action result is cached but the action itself has\n          expired. In this case, downloading the action itself would fail. Enabling this option\n          would unconditionally upload all actions, thus you will not hit any expiration issues.\n\n      --fail-fast\n          If Buck hits an error, do as little work as possible before exiting.\n          \n          To illustrate the effect of this flag, consider an invocation of `build :foo :bar`. The\n          default behavior of buck is to do enough work to get a result for the builds of each of\n          `:foo` and `:bar`, and no more. This means that buck will continue to complete the build\n          of `:bar` after the build of `:foo` has failed; however, once one dependency of `:foo` has\n          failed, other dependencies will be cancelled unless they are needed by `:bar`.\n          \n          This flag changes the behavior of buck to not wait on `:bar` to complete once `:foo` has\n          failed. Generally, this flag only has an effect on builds that specify multiple targets.\n          \n          `--keep-going` changes the behavior of buck to not only wait on `:bar` once one dependency\n          of `:foo` has failed, but to additionally attempt to build other dependencies of `:foo` if\n          possible.\n\n      --keep-going\n          If Buck hits an error, continue doing as much work as possible before exiting.\n          \n          See `--fail-fast` for more details.\n\n      --skip-missing-targets\n          If target is missing, then skip building instead of throwing error\n\n      --skip-incompatible-targets\n          If target is incompatible with the specified configuration, skip building instead of\n          throwing error. This does not apply to targets specified with glob patterns `/...` or `:`\n          which are skipped unconditionally\n\n      --materialize-failed-inputs\n          Materializes inputs for failed actions which ran on RE\n\n  -o, --output <PATH>\n          Output file path for profile data.\n          \n          File will be created if it does not exist, and overwritten if it does.\n\n      --mode <MODE>\n          Profile mode.\n          \n          Memory profiling modes have suffixes either `-allocated` or `-retained`.\n          \n          `-retained` means memory kept in frozen starlark heap after analysis complete. `-retained`\n          does not work when profiling loading, because no memory is retained after loading and\n          frozen heap is not even created. This is probably what you want when profiling analysis.\n          \n          `-allocated` means allocated memory, including memory which is later garbage collected.\n          \n          [possible values: time-flame, heap-flame-allocated, heap-flame-retained,\n          heap-summary-allocated, heap-summary-retained, statement, bytecode, bytecode-pairs,\n          typecheck, coverage]\n\n  -h, --help\n          Print help (see a summary with '-h')\n\nTarget Configuration Options:\n  -u, --target-universe <TARGET_UNIVERSE>\n          Comma separated list of targets to construct a configured target universe.\n          \n          When the option is specified, command targets are be resolved in this universe.\n          Additionally, `--target-platforms=` and `--modifier=` flags are be used to configure the\n          universe targets, not the command targets.\n          \n          This argument is particularly recommended on most non-trivial cqueries. In the absence of\n          this argument, buck2 will use the target literals in your cquery expression as the value\n          for\n          this argument, which may not be what you want.\n\n      --target-platforms <PLATFORM>\n          Configuration target (one) to use to configure targets\n\n  -m, --modifier <VALUE>\n          A configuration modifier to configure all targets on the command line.

However, if the two commands are based on different state, that\n          is they either have different configs or different filesystem states, buck2 cannot run\n          them in parallel. The default behavior in this case is to block the second command until\n          the first completes.\n\n          Possible values:\n          - never:            (default) When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with\n            this one, block that command\n          - always:           When another command starts, interrupt this command, *even if they\n            could run in parallel*. There is no good reason to use this other than that it provides\n            slightly nicer superconsole output\n          - ondifferentstate: When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with this one,\n            interrupt this command\n\nStarlark Options:\n      --disable-starlark-types\n          Disable runtime type checking in Starlark interpreter.\n          \n          This option is not stable, and can be used only locally to diagnose evaluation performance\n          problems.\n\n      --stack\n          Record or show target call stacks.\n          \n          Starlark call stacks will be included in duplicate targets error.\n          \n          If a command outputs targets (like `targets` command), starlark call stacks will be\n          printed after the targets.\n\nConsole Options:\n      --console <super|simple|...>\n          Which console to use for this command\n          \n          [env: BUCK_CONSOLE=]\n          [default: auto]\n          [possible values: simple, simplenotty, simpletty, super, auto, none]\n\n      --ui <UI>...\n          Configure additional superconsole ui components.\n          \n          Accepts a comma-separated list of superconsole components to add.
