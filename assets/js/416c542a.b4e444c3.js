If the timeout is exceeded, Buck2 will exit as quickly as\n          possible and not run further tests. In-flight tests will be cancelled. The test\n          orchestrator will be allowed to shut down gracefully.\n          \n          The exit code is controlled by the test orchestrator (which normally should report zero\n          for this).\n          \n          The format is a concatenation of time spans (separated by spaces).

Will reject actions that cannot execute locally\n          \n          [env: BUCK_OFFLINE_BUILD=]\n\n      --remote-only\n          Enable only remote execution. Will reject actions that cannot execute remotely\n\n      --prefer-local\n          Enable hybrid execution. Will prefer executing actions that can execute locally on the\n          local host\n\n      --prefer-remote\n          Enable hybrid execution.

If remote execution is enabled, the\n          RE service might still deduplicate actions, so for e.g. benchmarking, using a random\n          isolation dir is preferred\n          \n          [env: BUCK_OFFLINE_BUILD=]\n\n      --write-to-cache-anyway\n          Could be used to enable the action cache writes on the RE worker when no_remote_cache is\n          specified\n\n      --eager-dep-files\n          Process dep files when they are generated (i.e. after running a command that produces dep\n          files), rather than when they are used (i.e. before re-running a command that previously\n          produced dep files). Use this when debugging commands that produce dep files. Note that\n          commands that previously produced dep files will not re-run: only dep files produced\n          during this command will be eagerly loaded\n\n      --upload-all-actions\n          Uploads every action to the RE service, regardless of whether the action needs to execute\n          on RE.\n          \n          This is useful when debugging builds and trying to inspect actions which executed\n          remotely. It's possible that the action result is cached but the action itself has\n          expired. In this case, downloading the action itself would fail. Enabling this option\n          would unconditionally upload all actions, thus you will not hit any expiration issues.\n\n      --fail-fast\n          If Buck hits an error, do as little work as possible before exiting.\n          \n          To illustrate the effect of this flag, consider an invocation of `build :foo :bar`. The\n          default behavior of buck is to do enough work to get a result for the builds of each of\n          `:foo` and `:bar`, and no more. This means that buck will continue to complete the build\n          of `:bar` after the build of `:foo` has failed; however, once one dependency of `:foo` has\n          failed, other dependencies will be cancelled unless they are needed by `:bar`.\n          \n          This flag changes the behavior of buck to not wait on `:bar` to complete once `:foo` has\n          failed. Generally, this flag only has an effect on builds that specify multiple targets.\n          \n          `--keep-going` changes the behavior of buck to not only wait on `:bar` once one dependency\n          of `:foo` has failed, but to additionally attempt to build other dependencies of `:foo` if\n          possible.\n\n      --keep-going\n          If Buck hits an error, continue doing as much work as possible before exiting.\n          \n          See `--fail-fast` for more details.\n\n      --skip-missing-targets\n          If target is missing, then skip building instead of throwing error\n\n      --skip-incompatible-targets\n          If target is incompatible with the specified configuration, skip building instead of\n          throwing error. This does not apply to targets specified with glob patterns `/...` or `:`\n          which are skipped unconditionally\n\n      --materialize-failed-inputs\n          Materializes inputs for failed actions which ran on RE\n\n  -h, --help\n          Print help (see a summary with '-h')\n\nTarget Configuration Options:\n      --target-platforms <PLATFORM>\n          Configuration target (one) to use to configure targets\n\n  -m, --modifier <VALUE>\n          A configuration modifier to configure all targets on the command line.

However, if the two commands are based on different state, that\n          is they either have different configs or different filesystem states, buck2 cannot run\n          them in parallel. The default behavior in this case is to block the second command until\n          the first completes.\n\n          Possible values:\n          - never:            (default) When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with\n            this one, block that command\n          - always:           When another command starts, interrupt this command, *even if they\n            could run in parallel*. There is no good reason to use this other than that it provides\n            slightly nicer superconsole output\n          - ondifferentstate: When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with this one,\n            interrupt this command\n\nStarlark Options:\n      --disable-starlark-types\n          Disable runtime type checking in Starlark interpreter.\n          \n          This option is not stable, and can be used only locally to diagnose evaluation performance\n          problems.\n\n      --stack\n          Record or show target call stacks.\n          \n          Starlark call stacks will be included in duplicate targets error.\n          \n          If a command outputs targets (like `targets` command), starlark call stacks will be\n          printed after the targets.\n\nConsole Options:\n      --console <super|simple|...>\n          Which console to use for this command\n          \n          [env: BUCK_CONSOLE=]\n          [default: auto]\n          [possible values: simple, simplenotty, simpletty, super, auto, none]\n\n      --ui <UI>...\n          Configure additional superconsole ui components.\n          \n          Accepts a comma-separated list of superconsole components to add.
